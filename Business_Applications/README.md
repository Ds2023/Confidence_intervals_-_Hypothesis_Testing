## Background on the Marketing Data Project

This project entails working with historical marketing promotion data. We'll be carrying out a one way ANOVA test as well as a post-hoc ANOVA test to gain insight on how different promotions affect Sales in order to be able to make confident recomendations on future marketing budgets.

## Background on the Waze scenario

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

- Who are the users most likely to churn?

- Why do users churn? 

- When do users churn? 

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may lose these users without knowing why. 

Your insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.

### Project background

Waze’s data team is working on the churn project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:

- Explore the project data

- Implement a hypothesis test

- Communicate insights with stakeholders within Waze

### Assignment

You will conduct hypothesis testing on the data for the churn data. The data team has asked you to investigate Waze's dataset to determine which hypothesis testing method best serves the data and the churn project.

## Background on the Automatidata scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.

### Project background
Automatidata is working on the TLC project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:

- Explore the project data

- Implement a hypothesis test

## Background on the TikTok scenario 
At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company, and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

### Project background
TikTok’s data team is working on the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:

- Explore the project data

- Implement a hypothesis test

- Communicate insights with stakeholders within TikTok

### Assignment
You will conduct hypothesis testing on the data for the claims classification data. You’ve been asked to investigate TikTok's user claim dataset to determine which hypothesis testing method best serves the data and the claims classification project.

- Communicate insights with team members and TLC stakeholders

### Your assignment
You will conduct hypothesis testing on the data for the TLC data. You’ve been asked to investigate TLC’s dataset to determine which hypothesis testing method best serves the data and the TLC project.
